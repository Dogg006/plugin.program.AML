# Advanced MAME Launcher #

Advance MAME Launcher is a MAME front end for Kodi.

## Installing the latest released version ##

Follow [this link](https://github.com/Wintermute0110/repository.wintermute0110/tree/master/plugin.program.advanced.MAME.launcher) 
and download the ZIP file of the version you want.

## Installing the latest development version ##

It is important that you follow this instructions or Advanced Emulator Launcher won't work well.

  1) In this page click on the green button `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`

  2) Uncompress this ZIP file. This will create a folder named `plugin.program.advanced.MAME.launcher-master`

  3) Rename that folder to `plugin.program.advanced.MAME.launcher`

  4) Compress that folder again into a ZIP file. 

  5) In Kodi, use that ZIP file (and not the original one) to install the plugin in `System` --> `Addons` 
     --> `Install from ZIP file`.

  6) You are done!
