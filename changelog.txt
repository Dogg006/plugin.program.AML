FEATURE  Improved categories in "Machines by Control Type catalog".

FIX      "I get an error whenever trying to open any "Ball & Paddle" category. I'm pretty sure this 
         is due to the ampersand, because all the other categories I've tried work. This issue doesn't 
         affect ROMs with an ampersand in their name, like Cloak & Dagger."
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=304186&pid=2506150#pid2506150

         Problem was that the '&' in the Kodi URL was not escaped.
